# Stich Production - AI-Powered Web Application Generator

## Purpose

Define the main purpose of this project.

## Target Users

Describe who will use this.


## Project Summary

A sophisticated AI-powered web application generator built on Vercel's platform with Firebase backend. The system enables users to describe an application and have AI generate, deploy, and host it instantly using modern React, TypeScript, and serverless architecture. Features include multi-provider AI integration, real-time code generation, live previews, and one-click deployment.
