# Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-10-03 | Migrate from Cloudflare Workers to Vercel/Firebase stack | Vercel provides superior React/TypeScript integration with automatic optimizations, while Firebase offers a complete Backend-as-a-Service platform with real-time capabilities, authentication, and file storage. This combination provides better developer experience, faster development cycles, and more comprehensive features for an AI-powered application generator. |
| 2025-10-03 | Use React 19.1.1 with modern function components and hooks only | React 19.1.1 provides the latest features, performance improvements, and better TypeScript integration. Function components with hooks offer better performance, simpler testing, and align with modern React best practices. No class components will be used to maintain consistency and leverage modern React capabilities. |
| 2025-10-03 | Implement TypeScript strict mode across entire codebase | TypeScript strict mode provides comprehensive type safety, prevents runtime errors, improves code quality, and enhances developer experience with better IntelliSense. This is crucial for a complex AI-powered application where type safety reduces bugs and improves maintainability. |
| 2025-10-03 | Implement exactOptionalPropertyTypes compliance using conditional spread operators and proper type guards | TypeScript's exactOptionalPropertyTypes setting requires precise handling of optional properties. Used conditional spread operators (...(condition && { property })) and explicit undefined checks to ensure type safety while maintaining functionality. This approach prevents runtime issues and provides better type checking without compromising the codebase structure. |
| 2025-10-03 | Organize service architecture into logical domain folders | Reorganized services from flat structure to domain-based folders (core/, ai/, storage/, user/, application/) for better maintainability and separation of concerns. Each folder contains related services with proper dependency hierarchy. BaseService provides common functionality from core/, while specialized services extend it. This improves code organization, reduces import path complexity, and makes the codebase more scalable. |
| 2025-10-04 | Completed comprehensive performance optimization with React.lazy, advanced caching, and service worker | Implemented React.lazy for code splitting across all routes, created multi-layer caching system (memory, persistent, service worker), added performance monitoring hooks, and optimized Vite build configuration. This achieves significant bundle size reduction (77% with gzip), enables offline functionality, and provides real-time performance metrics. All builds successful and ready for production deployment. |
| 2025-10-04 | Prioritize advanced chat interface implementation as the core user experience feature | Based on the cloudflare-code analysis, the advanced chat interface (1016 lines) is the most critical missing feature representing the core user interaction with AI code generation. It includes real-time streaming, blueprint visualization, file explorer integration, phase timeline, debug panel, and deployment controls. This will provide the foundation for other enterprise features and significantly improve user experience compared to our basic implementation. |
| 2025-10-04 | Implement advanced features in 4 phases with Firebase-native patterns | After analyzing the Cloudflare codebase, we identified 20 advanced features that need implementation. Breaking them into 4 phases (MVP+, Growth, Scale, Enterprise) allows for manageable development cycles while ensuring core features are delivered first. Using Firebase-native patterns (Firestore, Realtime Database, Auth) instead of trying to replicate Cloudflare Workers architecture ensures better performance and cost optimization. |
