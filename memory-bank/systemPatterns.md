## Serverless Edge Architecture

Serverless Edge Computing pattern using Vercel for frontend hosting and Firebase Functions for backend API. This pattern provides global distribution, automatic scaling, and cost-effective infrastructure without server management.

### Examples

- Vercel deployment for React frontend with automatic CDN distribution
- Firebase Functions for API endpoints with Hono.js framework
- Auto-scaling based on traffic with pay-per-use pricing model


## Firebase Microservices Architecture

Service-oriented architecture using Firebase services as independent, loosely-coupled components. Each Firebase service (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Functions) handles specific business domains with clear boundaries.

### Examples

- Firebase Auth for user management and authentication
- Firestore for data persistence with real-time capabilities
- Firebase Storage for file management and CDN
- Firebase Functions for business logic and API endpoints


## Real-time Event-Driven Architecture

Real-time event-driven communication using Firebase Realtime Database and Firestore listeners. This pattern enables live updates during AI code generation, progress tracking, and collaborative features.

### Examples

- Firebase Realtime Database for live generation progress updates
- Firestore onSnapshot listeners for data synchronization
- Real-time collaboration during code generation process
- Live preview updates during application generation


## Conditional Property Assignment Pattern

Pattern for handling optional properties in TypeScript with exactOptionalPropertyTypes enabled. Uses conditional spread operators and type guards to ensure properties are only assigned when they have valid values, preventing undefined assignment issues.

### Examples

- ...(profile && { profile }) - Only assign profile if it exists
- ...(user.photoURL && { photoURL: user.photoURL }) - Conditional photoURL assignment
- const result = { data, hasMore, ...(hasMore && { lastDoc: docs[pageSize - 1] }) } - Conditional pagination metadata


## BaseService Extension Pattern

Service architecture pattern where all services extend a BaseService class that provides common Firebase operations, error handling, and utility methods. Each service handles a specific domain and follows consistent patterns for CRUD operations, validation, and error handling.

### Examples

- BaseService - Core functionality with handleError, createDocument, updateDocument methods
- UserService extends BaseService - User-specific operations
- StorageService extends BaseService - File management operations
- AIService extends BaseService - AI provider integration


## Systematic Todo List Management

Systematic approach to handling complex refactoring tasks by breaking them into trackable todo items. Each item has specific description, status tracking (not-started, in-progress, completed), and clear acceptance criteria. Enables incremental progress and proper task prioritization.

### Examples

- TypeScript error fixing broken into 6 specific tasks
- Service reorganization tracked as separate todo items
- Status updates after each completed task
- Clear descriptions with specific error counts and file locations


## Firebase-Native Advanced Features Architecture

A comprehensive pattern for implementing enterprise-grade features using Firebase services instead of external infrastructure. This includes using Firestore for complex permission systems, Realtime Database for real-time collaboration, Firebase Storage for file management, and Firebase Functions for business logic. The pattern emphasizes encryption for sensitive data, role-based access control through custom claims, and leveraging Firebase's built-in scalability for advanced features.

### Examples

- Firebase Realtime Database for live chat and collaboration
- Firestore security rules for role-based access control
- Firebase Functions with encrypted secret storage
- Firebase Analytics for comprehensive user tracking
- honoToFirebase adapter for seamless function integration
